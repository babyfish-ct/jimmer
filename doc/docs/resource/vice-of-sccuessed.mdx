                    <li>Dynamic objects fear no shape of DTO</li>
                    <li>Immutable objects allow you to ignore multi-threaded security issues and can be shared freely</li>
                    <li>Simple and smooth API brings an extremely comfortable development experience</li>
                    <li>Fully transparent caching mechanism allows you to escape from tedious work</li>
                </ul>
                So I strongly recommend Jimmer to liberate your productivity and get off work early!

                The concept of dynamic objects allows us to control every attribute of the object, which is the most exciting to solve the explosion of DTOs. The caching + computed properties are great!

                    <li>Extremely simple and smooth implicit table join mechanism</li>  
                    <li>No longer need to consider table partitioning based on join complexity during business analysis</li>
                    <li>Based on dynamic objects and Fetcher, the ability to control the field-level unlimited depth of object shapes makes it unnecessary to define DTOs when interfacing output</li>
                    <li>Support save instructions for arbitrary depth unlimited objects. No longer need to consider save logic based on object shape when adding and inserting. Just focus on building the object itself.</li>

                Jimmer breaks the traditional perception, integrates the advantages of mybatis and JPA, and has powerful, elegant, high-performance, easy-to-use and other excellent characteristics. The unlimited cascading object tree is great, highly recommend trying innovative features!
