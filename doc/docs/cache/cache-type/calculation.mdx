Calculated cache refers to mapping the current object id to the calculated value of the user-defined [complex calculated property](../../mapping/advanced/calculated/transient).

<CalculatedCache/>

## Calculated Property Recap

In the [Complex Calculated Properties](../../mapping/advanced/calculated/transient) article, we discussed complex calculated properties in detail.

:::caution
This article focuses on calculated cache and does not repeat the introduction to [complex calculated properties](../../mapping/advanced/calculated/transient). Please read [complex calculated properties](../../mapping/advanced/calculated/transient) before reading this article.
:::

In this article, we will add cache support for the calculated property `BookStore.avgPrice` defined in [complex calculated properties](../../mapping/advanced/calculated/transient).

:::info
To simplify the documentation, this article only discusses `BookStore.avgPrice` and does not discuss the other association-based calculated property `BookStore.newestBooks`. Readers can read and run the following official examples:

## Usage

List<BookStore> stores = sqlClient
    .createQuery(table)
    .select(
        table.fetch(
            BookStoreFetcher.$
                .allScalarFields()
                // highlight-next-line
                .avgPrice()
        )
    )
    .execute();
System.out.println(stores);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin 
val stores = sqlClient
    .createQuery(BookStore::class) {
        select(
            table.fetchBy {
                allScalarFields()
                // highlight-next-line
                avgPrice()

        )
    }
    .execute()
println(stores)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

-   Step 1: Query aggregate root

    First, query the aggregate root object, executing the following SQL:
    
    ```sql
    select
        tb_1_.ID,
        tb_1_.NAME,
        tb_1_.WEBSITE 
    from BOOK_STORE tb_1_
    ```

    The query in the code is implemented here to obtain some BookStore objects. Such objects obtained by direct user queries are called aggregate root objects.
    
    :::caution
    Jimmer does not cache aggregate objects returned by user queries, because the consistency of such query results cannot be guaranteed.

    Even if cache them at the cost of sacrificing consistency is required, it is a business need of the user rather than the framework.
    :::

-   Step 2: Convert current object id to calculated value via calculated cache

    The above code will return a series of aggregate root objects. If using the official sample data in the database, it will return two aggregate root objects.

    The object fetcher in the code contains the calculated property `BookStore.avgPrice`

    The primary keys `ID` of these 2 BOOK_STOREs are 1 and 2.
    
    Jimmer first looks up the data in Redis with keys `BookStore.avgPrice-1` and `BookStore.avgPrice-2`.

    Suppose the data corresponding to these keys cannot be found in Redis:
    ```
    127.0.0.1:6379> keys BookStore.avgPrice-*
    (empty array)
    ```

    So the following SQL is executed to compute the calculated property:
    ```sql
    select
        tb_1_.ID,
        avg(tb_2_.PRICE) 
    from BOOK_STORE tb_1_
    left join BOOK tb_2_
        on tb_1_.ID = tb_2_.STORE_ID
    where
        tb_1_.ID in (
            ? /* 1 */, ? /* 2 */
        )
    group by
        tb_1_.ID
    ```

    Jimmer will put the query results into Redis, so we can view this data in Redis:
    ```
    127.0.0.1:6379> keys BookStore.avgPrice-* 
    1) "BookStore.avgPrice-2"
    2) "BookStore.avgPrice-1"
    127.0.0.1:6379> get BookStore.avgPrice-1
    "58.5"
    127.0.0.1:6379> get BookStore.avgPrice-2
    "80.333333"
    127.0.0.1:6379>
    ```

    Thus, the two `BookStore` objects can obtain the average price of their respective books through their calculated property `BookStore.avgPrice`.

    Undoubtedly, before the data in Redis expires, executing the Java/Kotlin code above again will directly return the caculated data from Redis without generating the second SQL statement.

Finally, Jimmer concatenates the results of the 3 steps as the final data returned to the user:

```json
[
    {
        "id":2,
        "name":"MANNING", 
        "website":null,
        // highlight-next-line
        "avgPrice":58.5
    },
    {
        "id":1,
        "name":"O'REILLY",
        "website":null, 
        // highlight-next-line
        "avgPrice":80.333333
    }
]
```

## Cache Invalidation  

### Responding to Triggers

:::info
Unlike the fully automatic cache invalidation of object cache and association cache, maintaining the consistency of calculated cache requires user assistance.

This is because calculated properties introduce custom calculation rules that the ORM framework cannot understand.
:::

For the calculated property `BookStore.avgPrice`, the following two cases will both invalidate the calculated cache:

-   Modifying the `STORE_ID` foreign key field of the `BOOK` record will affect the `avgPrice` cache data of the two bookstores corresponding to the old and new values.

-   Modifying the `PRICE` field of the `BOOK` record will invalidate the `avgPrice` cache data of the bookstore it belongs to.

In the [Complex Calculated Properties](../../mapping/advanced/calculated/transient) article, a class `BookStoreAvgPriceResolver` is defined to support the calculated property `BookStore.avgPrice`. The code is as follows:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">  

```java title="BookStoreAvgPriceResolver.java"
package com.example.business.resolver;

import org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.*;
import org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.TransientResolver;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class BookStoreAvgPriceResolver implements TransientResolver<Long, BigDecimal> {
    
    @Override
    public Map<Long, BigDecimal> resolve(Collection<Long> ids) {
        ...omit code...
    }

    @Override
    public BigDecimal getDefaultValue() {
        ...omit code...
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin title="BookStoreAvgPriceResolver.kt" 
package com.example.business.resolver

import org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.*
import org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.kt.KTransientResolver
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component

@Component
class BookStoreAvgPriceResolver(
    ...omit...
) : KTransientResolver<Long, BigDecimal> {

    override fun resolve(ids: Collection<Long>): Map<Long, BigDecimal> {
        ...omit code...
    }

    override fun getDefaultValue(): BigDecimal =
        ...omit code...
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

We need to override the following two methods in this class:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java title="BookStoreAvgPriceResolver.java"  
package com.example.business.resolver;

import org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.*;
import org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.TransientResolver;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class BookStoreAvgPriceResolver implements TransientResolver<Long, BigDecimal> {
    
    // Constructor inject sqlClient  
    private final JSqlClient sqlClient;

    ...other code omitted...

    @Override
    // highlight-next-line
    Collection<?> getAffectedSourceIds(@NotNull EntityEvent<?> e) {
        // TODO
    }

    @Override
    // highlight-next-line 
    Collection<?> getAffectedSourceIds(@NotNull AssociationEvent e) {
        // TODO
    }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin title="BookStoreAvgPriceResolver.kt"
package com.example.business.resolver  

import org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.*
import org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.kt.KTransientResolver
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component

@Component
class BookStoreAvgPriceResolver(
    // Constructor inject sqlClient
    private val sqlClient: KSqlClient  
) : KTransientResolver<Long, BigDecimal> {

    ...other code omitted...

    // highlight-next-line
    override fun getAffectedSourceIds(e: EntityEvent<*>): Collection<*>? {
        // TODO
    }

    // highlight-next-line
    override fun getAffectedSourceIds(e: AssociationEvent): Collection<*>? {
        // TODO
    }
}
```

</TabItem> 
</Tabs>

These two methods are the built-in [trigger](../../mutation/trigger) response methods of `TransientResolver` that are executed automatically when the database changes. They are responsible for automatically clearing the computed cache when the database changes.

Next, let's implement these two methods.

### When BOOK.STORE_ID is modified

Users can change the association between `BOOK_STORE` and `BOOK` by modifying the `STORE_ID` foreign key of the `BOOK` table. This will inevitably affect `BookStore.avgPrice` of some bookstores.

:::tip
If watching for changes to the `Book.store` one-to-many association, the old and new values before and after the modification are two parent objects that need to be considered separately, making the code slightly more cumbersome.

Luckily, the entity model in this example has the reverse one-to-many association `BookStore.books`. When listening for changes to `BookStore.books`, we only need to consider the id of the current `BookStore` object, simplifying the code. 
:::

Implement `getAffectedSourceIds(AssociationEvent)` as follows:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
@Override  
public Collection<?> getAffectedSourceIds(AssociationEvent e) {
    if (sqlClient.getCaches().isAffectedBy(e) && ❶
        e.getImmutableProp() == BookStoreProps.BOOKS.unwrap() ❷
    ) {
        return Collections.singletonList(e.getSourceId()); ❸
    }
    return null;
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
override fun getAffectedSourceIds(e: AssociationEvent): Collection<*>? {
    if (sqlClient.caches.isAffectedBy(e) && ❶
        e.immutableProp == BookProps.BOOKS ❷
    ) {
        return listOf(e.sourceId) ❸
    }
    return null
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

-   ❶ If the trigger type is set to `BOTH`, any modification-caused trigger event notifications will be executed twice.
  
    :::note
    The 1st time: `e.connection` is non-null, indicating this is a notification from the Transaction trigger.
    
    The 2nd time: `e.connection` is null, indicating this is a notification from the BinLog trigger.
    :::

    However, the cache consistency maintenance work only needs to be done once, no need to do it twice.

    `sqlClient.caches.isAffectedBy(e)` can solve this problem, so that even if the trigger type is set to `BOTH`, the code here will only execute once.

    :::caution
    No matter whether Jimmer's trigger type is set to `BOTH` or not, it is recommended to include this check as a disciplinary measure.
    :::
  
-   ❷ If the `BookStore.books` one-to-many association is modified  

-   ❹ Then the `sourceId` of this association modification event *(i.e. the `BookStore` id)* needs to have the computed property cache `BookStore.avgPrice` cleared.

Now let's verify the effect of modifying `Book.store`:

-   If BinLog trigger is enabled, modifying the database by any means can lead to Jimmer's cache consistency intervention. For example, directly execute the following SQL in the SQL IDE:

    ```sql
    update BOOK
    /* Old value: 1, New value: 2 */ 
    set STORE_ID = 2
    where ID = 7;
    ```

-   If only Transaction trigger is enabled, Jimmer's API must be used to modify the database:

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java
    BookTable table = BookTable.$;
    sqlClient
        .createUpdate(table)
        // Old value: 1L, New value: 2L
        .set(table.store().id, 2L)
        .where(table.id().eq(7L))
        .execute();
    ```
    
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    
    ```kotlin
    sqlClient
        .createUpdate(Book::class) {
            // Old value: 1L, New value: 2L
            set(table.store.id, 2L)
            where(table.id eq 7L)
        }
        .execute()
    ```
    
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

Regardless of which way above is used to modify the data, you will see the following log output:

```
Delete data from redis: [Book-7]
Delete data from redis: [Book.store-7] 
Delete data from redis: [BookStore.avgPrice-1] ❶
Delete data from redis: [BookStore.books-1]
Delete data from redis: [BookStore.avgPrice-2] ❷
Delete data from redis: [BookStore.books-2]
```

-   ❶ The calculated cache `BookStore.avgPrice-1` of the parent object referenced by the old foreign key `1` is deleted.

-   ❷ The calculated cache `BookStore.avgPrice-2` of the parent object referenced by the new foreign key `2` is deleted.

### Modifying BOOK.PRICE

Users can also modify the `price` of books, which will inevitably affect `BookStore.avgPrice` of the bookstore it belongs to.

Implement `getAffectedSourceIds(EntityEvent<?>)`:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
@Override
public Collection<?> getAffectedSourceIds(EntityEvent<?> e) {
    if (sqlClient().getCaches().isAffectedBy(e) && ❶
        !e.isEvict() && ❷
        e.getImmutableType().getJavaClass() == Book.class) { ❸

        Ref<BookStore> storeRef = e.getUnchangedRef(BookProps.STORE); ❹
        if (storeRef != null && storeRef.getValue() != null && e.isChanged(BookProps.PRICE)) { ❺
            return Collections.singletonList(storeRef.getValue().id()); ❻  
        }
    }
    return null;
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
override fun getAffectedSourceIds(e: EntityEvent<*>): Collection<*>? {
    if (sqlClient.caches.isAffectedBy(e) && ❶
        !e.isEvict && ❷
        e.getImmutableType().javaClass == Book::class.java ❸
    ) {
        val store = e.getUnchangedRef(Book::store)?.value ❹
        if (store !== null && e.isChanged(Book::price)) { ❺
            return listOf(store.id) ❻
        }
    }
    return null
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

-   ❶ If the trigger type is set to `BOTH`, any modification-caused trigger event notifications will be executed twice.

    :::note
    The 1st time: `e.connection` is non-null, indicating this is a notification from the Transaction trigger.

    The 2nd time: `e.connection` is null, indicating this is a notification from the BinLog trigger.
    :::

    However, the cache consistency maintenance work only needs to be done once, no need to do it twice.

    `sqlClient.caches.isAffectedBy(e)` can solve this problem, so that even if the trigger type is set to `BOTH`, the code here will only execute once.

    :::caution
    No matter whether Jimmer's trigger type is set to `BOTH` or not, it is recommended to include this check as a disciplinary measure.
    :::
  
-   ❷ There are two reasons for Jimmer's event callbacks, whether it's `EntityEvent` or `AssociationEvent`.

    1. Explicitly know that the database has been modified
    
        In this case, `isEvict()` returns false. Users can access any property of `EntityEvent`/`AssociationEvent`.
        
    2. In the process of automatic cache eviction with cascading effect, the cache of an object/association needs to be evicted
    
        In this case, `isEvict()` returns true. Except for `EntityEvent.id`/`AssociationEvent.sourceId`, the event object does not support any other properties like `EntityEvent.newEntity`, `AssociationEvent.attachedTargetId`.
        
        Here, we need to explicitly determine if the user has modified the `PRICE` field of the `BOOK` table, so we must check `isEvict()` is false.

        :::warning  
        Whether to check `e.isEvict()` must be decided on a case-by-case basis.
        :::
    
-   ❸ Confirm that the current event was triggered because an object of type `Book` was modified.

-   ❹ ❺ `e.getUnchangedRef(BookProps.STORE)`/`e.getUnchangedRef(Book::store)` returns a `Ref` wrapper object containing the unchanged associated object *(only id property)* or null, if the `Book.store` association based on foreign key was not modified.

    :::info
    - If the returned `Ref` wrapper object itself is null, it means this property was modified rather than being `Unchanged`.
    
    - If the returned `Ref` wrapper object is non-null but its internal `value` is null, it means this property was not modified and its value has remained null all along.
    :::
    
    Ultimately, we expect the `BOOK.STORE_ID` foreign key field was not modified and has remained non-null.
    
    :::tip
    We don't need to consider the case where the foreign key field was modified here, because the other method we discussed earlier, `getAffectedSourceIds(AssociationEvent)`, will properly handle that case.
    :::
  
-   ❻ If all the above conditions are met, then the computed property cache `BookStore.avgPrice` of the `BookStore` parent object that the `price`-modified `Book` belongs to needs to be cleared.

Now let's verify the effect of modifying `Book.price`: 

-   If BinLog trigger is enabled, modifying the database by any means can lead to Jimmer's cache consistency intervention. For example, directly execute the following SQL in the SQL IDE:

    ```sql
    update BOOK
    set PRICE = PRICE + 1
    where ID = 7;
  ```
  
-   If only Transaction trigger is enabled, Jimmer's API must be used to modify the database:

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java

        .where(table.id().eq(7L))
        .execute();

        }

Regardless of which way above is used to modify the data, you will see the following log output:

```
