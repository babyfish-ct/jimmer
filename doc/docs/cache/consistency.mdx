title: Ensuring Cache Consistency
---

:::caution
In previous articles on [object caching](./cache-type/object), [association caching](./cache-type/association), and [computed caching](./cache-type/calculation), we have discussed in detail how Jimmer automatically deletes affected caches when data is modified.

So here we will not repeat the discussion of how Jimmer intelligently deletes affected caches. 

The focus of this article is how Jimmer ensures cache deletion operations issued can definitely succeed.
:::

Whether it is the fully automatic consistency of [object caching](./cache-type/object) and [association caching](./cache-type/association), or the user assisted consistency of [computed caching](./cache-type/calculation), the cache consistency of Jimmer is driven by [triggers](../mutation/trigger).

Jimmer triggers are divided into BinLog triggers and Transaction triggers.

For different situations, Jimmer adopts different strategies to ensure cache consistency, that is, to ensure that cache cleanup operations must succeed.


## Consistency of BinLog Trigger (Recommended)

When `trigger-type` is `BINLOG_ONLY` or `BOTH`, Jimmer uses the BinLog trigger to delete invalid caches.

In this case, developers respond to messaging queue notifications, process them simply and then call Jimmer's `BinLog` API *(this user code is very simple, and its complexity can be ignored)*. Calling the `BinLog` API initiates all trigger callbacks, including cache deletion.

Take Kafka as an example. As long as the `BinLog` API call succeeds before committing the consumption progress, cache cleanup can be guaranteed to eventually succeed.

## Consistency of Transaction Trigger 

When `trigger-type` is `TRANSACTION_ONLY`, Jimmer will be **forced** to use the Transaction trigger to delete invalid caches.

For Transaction triggers:

-   Caches will only be deleted when modifications caused by calling Jimmer APIs within the current App triggers callbacks, including cache deletion.

-   All trigger callbacks complete before the transaction is committed, including cache deletion.

If a simple implementation of direct cache deletion is adopted, any exception during cache deletion will cause the transaction to be rolled back. Obviously, this implementation is not reasonable.

Therefore, when `trigger-type` is `TRANSACTION_ONLY`, the cache deletion operations perceived by the user will be delayed. Cache deletion operations are not executed first, but are stored in the `JIMMER_TRANS_CACHE_OPERATOR` table. 

:::caution  
Jimmer will automatically create the `JIMMER_TRANS_CACHE_OPERATOR` table.

However, the default `org.babyfish.jimmer.sql.dialect.DefaultDialect` does not support this operation and will throw an exception.

So do not use the default `DefaultDialect`, be sure to specify the database dialect explicitly.  
:::

Modifications to the `JIMMER_TRANS_CACHE_OPERATOR` table and business tables belong to the same database local transaction, either both succeed or both fail.

After the transaction commits successfully, Jimmer will immediately execute a `Flush` operation.

The so-called `Flush` operation is to obtain cache deletion operations that have not yet been executed from the `JIMMER_TRANS_CACHE_OPERATOR` table as perceived by the user, execute the actual cache deletion operation, and delete related records if successful.

For the `Flush` operation executed immediately after transaction commit:

-   If successful, it's best to have good real-time performance. This should be the case most of the time.

-   Even if it fails, it doesn't matter. Because Jimmer will periodically execute `Flush` operations to ensure related cache operations eventually succeed. The interval of `Flush` operations is controlled by the global SpringBoot configuration item `jimmer.transaction-cache-operator-fixed-delay`, which is specified in milliseconds and defaults to 5000.
