## Premise of This Article

Jimmer supports [triggers](./trigger), including BinLog Triggers and Transaction Triggers.  

If using Transaction Triggers, it will cause Jimmer modification operations to generate more complete query statements to simulate triggers.

The various scenarios discussed in this article and their respective generated SQL are all based on the premise of not using Transaction Triggers.

## Basic Usage

The usage of the delete statement is:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java  
BookTable book = BookTable.$;

int affectedRowCount = sqlClient
    .createDelete(book) 
    .where(book.name().eq("Learning GraphQL"))
    .execute();
System.out.println("Affected row count: " + affectedRowCount);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val affectedRowCount = sqlClient
    .createDelete(Book::class) {
        where(table.name eq "Learning GraphQL")
    }
    .execute() 
println("Affected row count: $affectedRowCount")
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The generated SQL is:

```sql
delete  
from BOOK as tb_1_
where tb_1_.NAME = ?
```

## Using JOIN

The delete statement usage below supports JOIN clauses, as follows:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java 
BookTable book = BookTable.$;

int affectedRowCount = sqlClient
    .createDelete(book)
    .where(book.store().name().eq("MANNING")) 
    .execute();
System.out.println("Affected row count: " + affectedRowCount);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val affectedRowCount = sqlClient
    .createDelete(Book::class) {
        where(table.store.name eq "MANNING")
    }
    .execute()
println("Affected row count: $affectedRowCount") 
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The finally generated SQL is:

1. 
    ```sql
    select
        distinct tb_1_.ID
    from BOOK as tb_1_
    inner join BOOK_STORE as tb_2_
        on tb_1_.STORE_ID = tb_2_.ID
    where
        tb_2_.NAME = ? 
    ```

2.  
    ```sql
    delete from BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING
    where BOOK_ID in(?, ?, ?) 
    ```
3.  
    ```sql
    delete from BOOK
    where ID in(?, ?, ?)
    ```
    
:::note 
If JOIN is used in a delete statement, Jimmer will translate it into `select` + `delete`. First use the `select` statement with `join` clause to query the ids of the data to be deleted, then use [Delete Command](./delete-command) to delete the data.

This scheme is valid for any database.
