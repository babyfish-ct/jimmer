## Premise of This Article

Jimmer supports [triggers](./trigger), including BinLog Triggers and Transaction Triggers.

If using Transaction Triggers, it will cause Jimmer modification operations to generate more complete query statements to simulate triggers.

The various scenarios discussed in this article and their respective generated SQL are all based on the premise of not using Transaction Triggers.

## Basic Concepts  

The delete command deletes objects by id or id collection.

Necessary Explanations:

-   In the Java low-level API there are two methods ending in `Command`: `deleteCommand` and `batchDeleteCommand`.

    -   These two methods create commands but do not execute them immediately. After the user does more configuration on the command, calling `execute` executes it.

        Take `deleteCommand` as an example:

        ```java
        DeleteResult result = sqlClient
            .getEntities()
            .deleteCommand(BookStore.class, 1L) ❶
            .setDissociateAction(BookProps.STORE, DissociateAction.SET_NULL) ❷
            .execute(); ❸
        ```

        - ❶ Create the command, but do not execute it.
        
        - ❷ Configure the command, can be chained with multiple configurations *(here only one configuration is demoed)* 

        :::info
        The effect of this configuration will be explained later, readers can ignore it for now.
        :::
        
        - ❸ Finally execute it.

        Kotlin does not need such a design, because its delete method supports an optional Lambda parameter for configuration. Simply execute with the necessary configuration:

        ```kotlin
        val result = sqlClient
            .entities
            .delete(BookStore::class, 1L) {
                setDissociateAction(Book::store, DissociateAction.SET_NULL)
            }
        ```

-   In the Spring Data API we can find two methods with the same functionality but different names: `deleteByIds` and `deleteAllById`.

    - `deleteByIds`: A method consistent in style with the Jimmer low-level shortcut API.
  
    - `deleteAllById`: A required method when inheriting `org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository`, can be understood as an alias of `deleteByIds`.
  
-   The delete command supports two types of operations:

    -   Logical delete: Does not actually delete data, just marks the logical delete field of the object as "deleted".
  
    -   Physical delete: Actually deletes data.

    All the above APIs support an optional parameter of type `DeleteMode` through Java method overloading or Kotlin default parameters. This parameter type is an enum with three possible values:

    -   `AUTO`: Does not explicitly specify whether the current operation is logical delete or physical delete

        -   If the deleted entity type has a [logical delete field](../mapping/advanced/logical-deleted), perform logical delete.
        
        -   Otherwise, perform physical delete.

    -   `LOGICAL`: Explicitly specifies that the current operation is logical delete

        -   If the deleted entity type has a [logical delete field](../mapping/advanced/logical-deleted), perform logical delete.
        
        -   Otherwise, throw an exception indicating that the current entity does not support logical delete.

    -   `PHYSICAL`: Explicitly specifies that the current operation is physical delete
  
        Regardless of whether the deleted entity type has a [logical delete field](../mapping/advanced/logical-deleted), perform physical delete.

## Logical Delete  

Assuming the entity has a [logical delete field](../mapping/advanced/logical-deleted), for example:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java title="Book.java"
@Entity
public interface Book {

    // highlight-next-line  
    @LogicalDeleted("true")
    boolean isDeleted();

    ...other code omitted...
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin title="Book.kt"
@Entity
interface Book {

    // highlight-next-line
    @LogicalDeleted("true")
    val isDeleted: Boolean

    ...other code omitted...
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then the following three behaviors:

-   `sqlClient.deleteById(Book.class, 1L)`
-   `sqlClient.deleteById(Book.class, 1L, DeleteMode.AUTO)` 
-   `sqlClient.deleteById(Book.class, 1L, DeleteMode.LOGICAL)`

have the same function, they all represent logical delete, and generate the following sql:

```sql
update BOOK  
set DELETED = ? /* true */
where ID in(?/* 1L*/)
```

## Physical Delete  

If the entity does not have a [logical delete field](../mapping/advanced/logical-deleted), or the delete mode is explicitly specified as `DeleteMode.PHYSICAL`, physical delete is performed. 

### Basic Usage

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
DeleteResult result = sqlClient
    .getEntities()
    .batchDelete(Book.class, Arrays.asList(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L));

System.out.println(
    
    "Affected row count: " +
    result.getTotalAffectedRowCount() + 

    "\nAffected row count of table 'BOOK': " +
    result.getAffectedRowCount(AffectedTable.of(Book.class)) +
    
    "\nAffected row count of middle table 'BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING': " +
    result.getAffectedRowCount(AffectedTable.of(BookProps.AUTHORS))
);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin 
val result = sqlClient
    .entities
    .batchDelete(Book::class, listOf(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L))
println(
    """Affected row count:
        |${result.totalAffectedRowCount}
        |Affected row count of table 'BOOK':
        |${result.affectedRowCount(Book::class)} 
        |Affected row count of middle table 'BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING':
        |${result.affectedRowCount(Book::authors)}
    """.trimMargin()  
)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The finally generated SQL is: 

1. 
    ```sql
    delete from BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING
    where BOOK_ID in(?, ?, ?, ?) 
    ```

2. 
    ```sql
    delete from BOOK
    where ID in(?, ?, ?, ?)
    ```

### Dissociate Operation  

From the above discussion we can see that the delete command may cause data in many-to-many association middle tables to be deleted, which is a relatively simple case.

For one-to-one or one-to-many associations directly based on foreign keys, the situation to be handled is a little more complex.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java 
DeleteResult result = sqlClient
    .getEntities()
    .delete(BookStore.class, 1L);

System.out.println(

    "Affected row count: " +
            result.getTotalAffectedRowCount() +

            "\nAffected row count of table 'BOOK_STORE': " +
            result.getAffectedRowCount(AffectedTable.of(BookStore.class)) +

            "\nAffected row count of table 'BOOK': " + 
            result.getAffectedRowCount(AffectedTable.of(Book.class)) +

            "\nAffected row count of middle table 'BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING': " +
            result.getAffectedRowCount(AffectedTable.of(BookProps.AUTHORS))
);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val result = sqlClient
    .entities
    .delete(BookStore::class, 1L)
println(  
    """Affected row count:
        |${result.totalAffectedRowCount}
        |Affected row count of table 'BOOK_STORE':
        |${result.affectedRowCount(BookStore::class)}
        |Affected row count of table 'BOOK':
        |${result.affectedRowCount(Book::class)}
        |Affected row count of middle table 'BOOK_AUTHOR_MAPPING':
        |${result.affectedRowCount(Book::authors)} 
    """.trimMargin()
)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This code deletes a `BookStore` object. 

Because the `BookStore` object has a one-to-many association `BookStore.books`, if the object being deleted already has some associated objects in the database, Jimmer will discard those objects.

The one-to-many association `BookStore.books` is not a mapping based on a middle table, but a mapping based on a foreign key. How will Jimmer discard those `Book` objects?

Unlike JPA, Jimmer does not allow direct use of `@OneToOne` and `@OneToMany` for association mapping. `@OneToOne` and `@OneToMany` must use the `mappedBy` attribute. See [@OneToMany](../mapping/base/association/one-to-many) to learn more.  

This means that through the one-to-many association `BookStore.books` we can certainly find the corresponding many-to-one association `Book.store`.

Next, Jimmer will refer to the [@OnDissociate](../mapping/advanced/on-dissociate) annotation on the many-to-one association property `Book.store`.

1.  If the foreign key corresponding to `Book.store` is configured by the [@OnDissociate](../mapping/advanced/on-dissociate) annotation as `SET_NULL`, the following SQL is executed:

    ```sql
    update BOOK set STORE_ID = null where STORE_ID in(?)
    ```
    where the parameter is the id of the deleted object. Thus, the foreign keys of these discarded objects are set to null.
    
2.  Otherwise, first execute:

    ```sql
    select ID from BOOK where STORE_ID in(?) 
    ```
    where the parameter is the id of the deleted object. Thus, the ids of these discarded objects are obtained.

    > If the query does not return any data, skip the subsequent steps.

    - If the foreign key corresponding to `Book.store` is configured by [@OnDissociate](../mapping/advanced/on-dissociate) as `DELETE`, use the new delete command to delete these discarded objects. This is actually the automatic recursive execution capability of the delete command.

    - Otherwise, throw an exception.
    
The above discussed situations all require the developer to use the [@OnDissociate](../mapping/advanced/on-dissociate) annotation on the `Book.store` attribute. 

However, you can also choose not to use the [@OnDissociate](../mapping/advanced/on-dissociate) annotation, but dynamically specify the dissociateAction configuration for the delete command.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
DeleteResult result = sqlClient
    .getEntities()
    .deleteCommand(BookStore.class, 1L)
    .configure(it ->
            it
                // highlight-next-line 
                .setDissociateAction(
                    BookProps.STORE,
                    DissociateAction.SET_NULL
                )
    )
    .execute();
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">  

```kotlin 
val result = sqlClient
    .entities
    .delete(BookStore::class, 1L) {
        // highlight-next-line
        setDissociateAction(
            Book::store,
            DissociateAction.SET_NULL  
        )
    }
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Here, calling the command's `setDissociateAction` method dynamically has the same effect as using the [@OnDissociate](../mapping/advanced/on-dissociate) annotation statically on the `Book.store` attribute and specifying cascade delete.

:::info
1.  If the last parameter of the `setDissociateAction` method is `DissociateAction.SET_NULL`, the associated attribute being set must be nullable, otherwise it will cause an exception.

2.  If dissociation rules are configured dynamically for the save command and also configured statically in the entity interface through the [@OnDissociate](../mapping/advanced/on-dissociate) annotation, the dynamic configuration takes precedence.
