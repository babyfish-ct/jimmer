:::caution
This is a very crude solution, only for learning or very simple projects.
:::

Limitation: Can only save single table data, cannot persist complex data structures.

Functionality: Resolves security issue *(this issue is discussed in [previous doc](./problem))*. 

Advantage: No need to define Input DTOs.

Disadvantage: Does not resolve API ambiguity issue *(this issue is discussed in [previous doc](./problem))*.

<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

@PutMapping("/book")

    @RequestBody Book book  
) {
    // highlight-next-line
    if (!ImmutableObjects.isLonely(book)) {
        throw new IllegalArguemntException("The input object is too complex");
    }
    bookRepository.save(book);
}
```

<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
@PutMapping("/book")
fun saveBook(
    // highlight-next-line 
    @RequestBody book: Book
) {
    // highlight-next-line
    if (!isLonely(book)) {
        throw IllegalArguemntException("The input object is too complex")
    }
    bookRepository.save(input)
} 
```

This example directly uses the Jimmer dynamic object as the parameter, without restricting the complexity of the passed data structure. But we added a validation to throw an exception if the parameter is not a lonely object, to ensure security.

`isLonely` is used to determine if a dynamic object is just a lonely object. A lonely object can only have two kinds of properties:

-   Scalar properties

-   Association properties based on foreign keys, but can only be assigned `null` or associated objects with just the `id` property.

It is easy to see that the validation in the above code ensures all `insert` or `update` operations can only apply to one table.

If the developer thinks:

-   Restricting functionality to only modifying one table achieves the security limit needed

-   The other API ambiguity issue is acceptable

Then this is indeed a very crude but usable solution.
