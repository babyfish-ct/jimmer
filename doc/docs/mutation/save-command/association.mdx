## Association Types  

From the user's perspective, there are two types of associations in the data structure to be saved:

### Short Association

A so-called short association indicates that only the association itself between the current object and other objects is modified, with no interest in modifying the associated objects.

Usually, the UI design will use radio buttons *(associated reference)* or checkboxes *(associated collection)*. 

<ShortAssociation/>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

Where:

-   Radio buttons correspond to the many-to-one association `Book.store`

-   Checkboxes correspond to the many-to-many association `Book.authors`

:::note
In actual projects, the available data may be too much to be designed as a dropdown UI. In this case, an object selector with filtering and pagination can be used instead of a dropdown, which is a common workaround.
:::

Since the user only wants to modify the association itself between the current object and other objects, without further modifying the associated objects, the UI cannot have nested multi-level associations. This is why it is called a **short association**. 

:::info
When passing data structures of arbitrary shapes as parameters to the save command, short associations can be specified in two ways:

-   The associated object has only the id property

-   The associated object has only the key property  
:::

Two examples are shown below:

-   The associated object has only the id property:

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java 
    Book book = BookDraft.$.produce(draft -> {
        draft.setName("SQL in Action");
        draft.setEdition(1);
        draft.setPrice(new BigDecimal("39.9"));
        draft.applyStore(store -> {
            // Associated object has only id property  
            // highlight-next-line
            store.setId(2L);
        });
        draft.addIntoAuthors(author -> {
            // Associated object has only id property
            // highlight-next-line 
            author.setId(4L); 
        });
        draft.addIntoAuthors(author -> {
            // Associated object has only id property
            // highlight-next-line
            author.setId(5L);
        });
    });
    sqlClient.save(book);
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin
    val book = new(Book::class).by {
        name = "SQL in Action"
        edition = 1
        price = BigDecimal("39.9")
        store().apply {
            // Associated object has only id property
            // highlight-next-line
            id = 2L
        }
        authors().addBy {
            // Associated object has only id property
            // highlight-next-line
            id = 4L
        }
        authors().addBy {
            // Associated object has only id property 
            // highlight-next-line
            id = 5L
        }
    }
    sqlClient.save(book)
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    :::note
    The data structure is hard-coded here only for demonstration. In actual projects the data structure to be saved is submitted by the front-end UI.

    Of course, if the user defines the `authorIds` property according to [Mapping Section/Advanced Mapping/View Properties/IdView](../../mapping/advanced/view/id-view), the above code can be simplified, for example:
    
    ```
    draft.setAuthorIds(Arrays.asList(4L, 5L));
    ```
    
    For greater applicability of the examples, it is not assumed here that the user has defined [IdView](../../mapping/advanced/view/id-view) properties for the entity type. Subsequent documents will not be reminded again. 
    :::
    
-   The associated object has only the key property:

    :::note
    In the following code, it is assumed that:
    
    - The key property of `BookStore` type is `name`

    - The key properties of `Author` type are `firstName` and `lastName`

        > In actual projects, this uniqueness constraint is not reasonable. It is assumed here to simplify the example. Please don't take this detail too seriously.

### Long Association

A so-called long association indicates that in addition to modifying the association itself between the current object and other objects, the associated objects need to be further modified. 

Usually, the UI design will use nested tables, for example:

<LongAssociation/>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

Since the user wants not only to modify the association between the current object and other objects, but also to further modify the associated objects, and the associated objects can contain deeper associations, theoretically the UI can have nested multi-level associations. This is why it is called a **long association**.

:::note
Although designers deliberately avoid nesting deeper nested tables in nested tables to ensure UI simplicity, there are still scenarios in actual projects that require maintaining multi-level nested associations on the UI, such as:

- The form itself is a tree structure that is edited and then saved as a whole.

- Visual UI design, because the UI components themselves are tree structures. After a series of visual drag-and-drop designs by the user, the UI component tree is saved as a whole.
:::

:::info
When passing data structures of arbitrary shapes as parameters to the save command, long associations can be specified in two ways:

- If the id property has already been specified for the associated object, continue to specify any non-id properties for the object *(including key properties)*

- If all key properties have already been specified for the associated object, continue to specify any properties that are neither id nor key for the object

## Speciality of One-To-Many Associations

It was mentioned before:

:::info
If the entity type declares the Key property *(which also means the id has no business meaning other than serving as a unique identifier)*, then

-   For the aggregated root object to be saved, it is recommended to specify either the id property or the key property, otherwise it will be understood as forced insertion.

-   For associated objects to be saved, either the id property or all key properties must be specified, otherwise an exception will occur.
:::


However, there is one exceptional case for one-to-many relationships.

Let's look at an example:

### Entity Definition

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java title="TreeNode.java"
@Entity
public interface TreeNode {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    long id();

    // highlight-next-line
    @Key 
    String name();

    // highlight-next-line
    @Key
    @Nullable
    @ManyToOne
    TreeNode parent();

    ...other properties omitted... 
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin title="TreeNode.kt" 
@Entity
public interface TreeNode {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    val id: Long

    // highlight-next-line
    @Key
    val name: String

    // highlight-next-line
    @Key 
    @ManyToOne
    val parent: TreeNode?

    ...other properties omitted...
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Using Save Command

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java 
TreeNode treeNode = TreeNodeDraft.$.produce(food -> {
    food
        // highlight-next-line
        .setParent(null)
        .setName("Food")
        .addIntoChildNodes(drink -> {
            drink
                .setName("Drink")
                .addIntoChildNodes(cococola -> {
                    cococola.setName("Cococola");
                })
                .addIntoChildNodes(fanta -> {
                    fanta.setName("Fanta");
                });
            ;
        })
        .addIntoAuthors(bread -> {
            bread
                .setName("Bread")
                .addIntoChildNodes(daguette -> {
                    daguette.setName("Baguette");
                })
                .addIntoChildNodes(ciabatta -> {
                    ciabatta.setName("Ciabatta");
                })
        });
    ;
});
sqlClient.save(treeNode);
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val treeNode = new(TreeNode::class).by {
    // highlight-next-line
    parent = null
    name = "Food"
    childNodes().addBy {
        name = "Drinks" 
        childNodes().addBy {
            name = "Cococola"
        }
        childNodes().addBy {
            name = "Fanta"
        }
    }
    childNodes().addBy {
        name = "Bread"
        childNodes().addBy {
            name = "Baguette"
        }
        childNodes().addBy {
            name = "Ciabatta"
        }
    }
}
sqlClient.save(treeNode)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The key properties of the `TreeNode` type are `name` and `parent`:

-   For the root node, if the id property is not specified, it is recommended to specify the `name` and `parent` properties, otherwise it will be understood as forced insertion.

-   For the child nodes, if the id property is not specified, the `name` and `parent` properties must be specified, otherwise an exception will occur.

However, in this example, except for the root node object, the `parent` property of all other objects is not specified. This code does not seem to execute normally.

In fact, this code can run correctly, because the save command makes a special provision for one-to-many associations: 

:::tip
If the data structure to be saved contains some child objects held by the parent object through a one-to-many association *(`TreeNode.childNodes` in this example)*, then the reverse many-to-one association of these child objects *(`TreeNode.parent` in this example)* will be deemed by the save command to have been set.
:::

So in the above example, the save command will consider the `parent` property of all child nodes to have already been set. That is, all child objects have both the `name` and `parent` properties at the same time, so the save command can run smoothly.

## Dissociate Operations  

For associated objects, insert or update operations are not much different from saving the aggregated root object operations introduced earlier. The user just needs to remember that associated objects are not controlled by [Save Mode](./save-mode) *(or it can be considered that the save mode for associated objects is only `UPSERT`)*.

However, associated objects have a very special operation: dissociation. 

Dissociation is a very important concept. Due to limited space, we will discuss it in detail in the [next document](./dissociation).
