## Project Positioning 

Jimmer is a revolutionary ORM for Java and Kotlin, as well as a complete suite of solutions built on top of it (including a powerful cache management mechanism).

Currently, there are many Java-based relational database upper-layer technology solutions, including ORM and non-ORM styles. There are so many such solutions that Jimmer does not want to add any duplication.

In fact, completing basic CRUD access to databases is only the most fundamental and simple part of actual project work. There are some other pain points that have always plagued developers, which are more complex and cumbersome than simple data CRUD.

Jimmer collects most of the common and cumbersome problems in business project development, and provides a comprehensive set of solutions.

ORM is just Jimmer's entry point, not the entirety.

## Pain Points

As mentioned earlier, completing basic CRUD access to databases is only the most fundamental and simple part of actual project work. Here are some common pain points that have always plagued developers:

1.  DTO explosion problem

    Even for the same data type (aggregate root), different business functions expect query data formats to be different, which often leads projects to define a large number of DTO types, forming a <ViewMore buttonText="DTO explosion problem"><DtoExplosion/></ViewMore>.

    :::info
    The number of DTO types is huge, and although they are different from each other, they often have high redundancy with high similarity.
   
    Especially for mobile applications, due to the limitation of screen size leading to severe UI fragmentation, even for the same data type (aggregate root), different UI screens will have different emphases, further exacerbating this situation.
    :::

    The large number of highly redundant DTO types is cumbersome and difficult to maintain. At the business code implementation level, it also makes traditional solutions (whether ORM or non-ORM) very inconvenient to handle, for example:

    -   Traditional ORM solutions

        Although they have good convenience, they lack flexibility.
     
        Even considering JPA 2.1's [Entity Graph](https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-entity-graph), the flexibility is still limited, especially when business scenarios only need part of scalar properites of entity objects.
     
        Finally, in order to cope with ever-changing flexibility, especially the flexibility of only needing part of an object's properites, developers often choose to query only part of an object's properites and manually convert them to DTO types. This goes against the purpose of ORM to pursue convenience and fails to reflect the value of ORM.

        :::info
        To make up for the lack of flexibility in traditional ORM, developers often have to work around in ways that undermine the original purpose of ORM: convenience.
        :::

        :::note
        This is one of the common criticisms of people who oppose ORM, believing that ORM attempts to replace SQL but does not achieve its purpose. This view has its merits.
        :::
     
    -    Non-ORM solutions represented by MyBatis
   
        They are flexible but have serious repetitive labor problems.
     
        Facing various types of DTO queries, developers often need to define a lot of similar but different `Result Mappers`, and even manual data stitching operations if necessary. This represents a huge workload.

        :::info
        This solution has absolute flexibility and control (it can do very little work for you, most of the time it is the code written by developers to complete the functions, which is of course flexible), but at the cost of high workload. The R&D capability of the team is directly reflected in the number of people and communication costs.
        :::
     
    :::tip
    Through innovation, thoroughly unleash the flexibility of ORM and form a new solution that combines the convenience of ORM and the flexibility of MyBatis. This is one of the core values of Jimmer.
    :::

    To this end, Jimmer's solution is to query data structures of arbitrary shapes <ObjectFetcher/>
   
2.  Complex form problem

    Often, the data structure that the client needs to save is not a flat object, but a <ViewMore buttonText="data structure with some complexity"><LongAssociation/></ViewMore>. If developers have to compare the differences between the client data structure and the existing data and perform appropriate insert/update/delete operations, it would be very cumbersome.
   
    Also, similar to the query function, the data structure format that can be saved for the same aggregate root type by different business functions should be diversified, and should not be fixed at the ORM level through configuration.

    For this, Jimmer's solution is to save data structures of arbitrary shapes <SaveCommand/>
   
3.  Cache

    -   Whether to use cache should be completely transparent to developers. Introducing cache should not increase the complexity of business code, reduce code quality and maintainability, and should be as simple as pure SQL projects.

    -   The cache should not only have simple object caching, but also <ViewMore buttonText="Association Cache"><AssociationCache/></ViewMore> and <ViewMore buttonText="Calculated Cache"><CalculatedCache/></ViewMore>.

    -   Global filtering capabilities represented by permission systems often allow different users to see different data, therefore, different users to see different cache. So <ViewMore buttonText="Multi-view cache"><MultiViewCache/></ViewMore> should be supported.
   
    -   Cache consistency maintenance, the most headache problem, <ViewMore buttonText="should be solved by the underlying solution" title="Automatically Maintaining Cache Consistency"><CacheConsistencyPanel/></ViewMore> as much as possible, rather than penetrating into business code for developers to solve.
   
4.  Dynamic Table Joins

    Traditional database access technologies only focus on `dynamic where` conditions and do not focus on `dynamic table joins`, 
    This leads to <ViewMore buttonText="difficulties" title="Problems with Missing Dynamic Table Joins"><DynamicJoinProblemPanel/></ViewMore> in writing complex dynamic queries.
    
5.  Automatic client integration

    -   The server should automatically generate client code (such as TypeScript) for clients (such as web frontends).
   
    -   The server is the producer. Developers want to see simplified APIs and programming models, because it means less work to be done. The client is the consumer. Developers want to see complete APIs and programming models, because it means it’s comfortable to use. The traditional approach of making server and client APIs and programming models completely consistent needs to be changed.
   
6.  Microservice data stitching

    In microservice architectures, the database is fragmented. Querying different parts of the data from different microservices first, and then stitching them together as a whole to return is cumbersome and frequent, so it should be hidden and automated by the underlying solution.
   
## Revolutionary Features
   
To solve these pain points, Jimmer provides many disruptive features.

### 1. Query data structures of arbitrary shapes

The flexibility that GraphQL can only obtain through remote HTTP access has become ubiquitous local code behavior that can be considered GraphQLization of ORM. 

This feature also solves a flaw in GraphQL: inability to recursively query self-associated properties.

<ObjectFetcher/>&nbsp;<Button href="../query/object-fetcher" size="small">Learn More</Button>

### 2. Save data structures of arbitrary shapes

-   The shape of the data structure to be saved should be arbitrarily determined by the developer, rather than fixed configuration on entities as in traditional ORM (such as the cascade parameter of `@OneToMany` annotation in JPA)

-   It should be like <a href="https://react.dev/learn">React</a> or <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> in the web area. Developers only need to provide the data structure to be covered, and the framework will automatically find the `DIFF` and execute SQL operations.

<SaveCommand/>&nbsp;<Button href="../mutation/save-command" size="small">Learn More</Button>

### 3. Cache data structures of arbitrary shapes 

This is a very important feature of Jimmer. Its cache mechanism is very powerful and completely transparent to business code.

:::note
In long-term technical management experience, I have found that most development teams can keep the code clean and maintainable for pure database projects. However, once a cache system is introduced, the maintainability of the project decreases sharply.

Therefore, Jimmer introduces this set of powerful cache management mechanisms that have 0 invasion into business code, while fully enjoying the benefits of cache mechanisms, keeping business code as simple and easy to maintain as pure database projects.
:::

This caching mechanism supports the following important concepts:

-   <ViewMore buttonText="Object Cache"><ObjectCache/></ViewMore>, <ViewMore buttonText="Association Cache"><AssociationCache/></ViewMore> and <ViewMore buttonText="Calculated Cache"><CalculatedCache/></ViewMore>

-   <ViewMore buttonText="Multi-view Cache"><MultiViewCache/></ViewMore>, different caches visible to different users, often combined with permission systems

-   <ViewMore buttonText="Automatically Cache Invalidation"><CacheConsistencyPanel/></ViewMore>

<Button href="../cache" size="small">Learn More</Button>

### 4. Dynamic table join

Jimmer's DSL is not a mechanical translation of SQL. Its original `dynamic table join` fills the industry gap, allowing even the most complex dynamic queries to be easily written.

:::note
The lack of `dynamic table join` is an industry gap, and also the fuse for the Jimmer project to be launched. 
:::

<ViewMore buttonText="Brief Understanding" title="Problems Without Dynamic Table Join"><DynamicJoinProblemPanel/></ViewMore>&nbsp;<Button href="../query/dynamic-join" size="small">Learn More</Button>

### 5. Front-end integration 

For REST services, generate client code (such as TypeScript) for clients (such as web frontends).

Note that unlike other technologies that automatically generate client code, the programming models on the server side and client side are different.

-   The server side as a producer, its programming model is simplified (eliminating DTO explosions), greatly reducing implementation costs

-   The client side as a consumer adopts a complete programming model (recreating DTO explosions), which provides a good development experience

Thus, the server side and client side both get programming models most suitable for themselves

<Communication/>&nbsp;<Button href="../spring/client" size="small">Learn More</Button>

### 6. Smart Pagination

-   Extremely simple
  
    Developers only need to write queries for all data before paging. Queries for total number of rows and query page data will be automatically generated. So Jimmer's paged queries will make you feel unprecedentedly simple.
  
-   Fully optimized

    Jimmer will fully optimize paged queries at the SQL level

### 7. DTO Language

DTO Language is a simple language that comes with Jimmer.

Even in some special scenarios where we cannot directly use the unified ORM entity and have to use DTO objects, the development cost is only to define the shape of these DTOs using the DTO language. 
The remaining work

-   DTO related Java/Kotlin definitions

-   Data transformation logic between entities and DTOs

-   Logic to query DTOs

are all automatic, completely without the pain caused by DTO explosions in traditional technical solutions.

### 8. Remote associations

In microservice architectures, the database is fragmented. Querying different parts of the data from different microservices first, and then stitching them together as a whole to return is cumbersome and frequent, so it should be hidden and automated by the underlying solution.

## Framework Comparison 

Jimmer is a comprehensive solution with many powerful features. Some of these features are originally created by Jimmer, while others are similar to some other technology systems. Drawing analogies can help users with relevant experience understand them.

The features that can be analogous to other similar technical systems include:

-   Unlike GraphQL which is only used as a protocol for exposing HTTP interfaces, Jimmer extends this capability to ORM APIs, that is, ubiquitous local code invocations. *(Of course, you can also choose to quickly expose GraphQL using Jimmer's capabilities)*

There is an essential difference between save commands and save methods in other ORM frameworks.

Take JPA/Hibernate as an example. Whether ordinary properites need to be saved is controlled by [Column.insertable](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/Column.html#insertable--) and [Column.updatable](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/Column.html#updatable--),
and whether associated properites need to be saved is controlled by [OneToOne.cascade](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/OneToOne.html#cascade--), [ManyToOne.cascade](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/ManyToOne.html#cascade--), [OneToMany.cascade](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/OneToMany.html#cascade--) and [ManyToMany.cascade](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/ManyToMany.html#cascade--). However, no matter how developers configure, the shape of the data structure that JPA/Hibernate can save for you is fixed.

Jimmer adopts a completely different approach. Jimmer objects have [dynamic](../object/dynamic) capabilities. The properites that are set will be saved, while those not set will be ignored, so that data structures of arbitrary shapes can be saved.

Unlike MapStruct's focus on technical neutrality, the DTO language is tailored for Jimmer with a focus on extremely high development efficiency.

Even in some special scenarios where we cannot directly use the unified ORM entity and have to use DTO objects, the development cost is only to define the shape of these DTOs. All the remaining work *(DTO related Java/Kotlin definitions, mutual transformation logic between entities, and interaction logic with databases)* is fully automated. You won't feel the pain caused by DTO explosions in traditional technical solutions at all.
