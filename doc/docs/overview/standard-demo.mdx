:::tip
Running the examples that come with the framework is the most efficient way to get familiar with Jimmer.  
:::

## Prerequisites

Like [JOOQ](https://www.jooq.org/), [JPA2.0 Criteria](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gjitv.html), [QueryDSL](http://querydsl.com/), [MyBatis-Flex](https://github.com/mybatis-flex/mybatis-flex), [Fluent-MyBatis](https://github.com/atool/fluent-mybatis) and other types of strong-typed SQL DSL implementations, Jimmer needs to generate more source code based on user code.

- For Java, it is annotation processor
- For Kotlin, it is ksp

When a user opens the accompanying examples in an IDE (such as IntelliJ) for the first time, some classes that should have been automatically generated will be missing.

Don't panic, click the run button and all errors will disappear automatically.

## Example Introduction

The accompanying examples of Jimmer are very helpful for quickly mastering Jimmer.

The root directory of all examples: https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer/tree/main/example

This project provides 5 examples, each with Java and Kotlin versions, for a total of 10 projects.

:::tip
When getting started, the most important examples are `jimer-sql` and `jimmer-sql-kt`. Open either of them according to your language preference:

- Java

  [example/java/jimmer-sql](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer/tree/main/example/java/jimmer-sql)
  
- Kotlin

  [example/kotlin/jimmer-sql-kt](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer/tree/main/example/kotlin/jimmer-sql-kt)
:::

## Non-Cache Mode 

Non-cache mode is the default running mode for all examples. No external environment needs to be installed for them to run directly. 

If an example depends on a database, it will use the H2 in-memory database in non-cache mode, and automatically create the database at startup.

As you can see, non-cache mode is very simple and ideal for quickly getting familiar with the examples.

## Cache Mode

As introduced above, there are 10 accompanying examples, 4 of which can demonstrate Jimmer's caching and cache consistency.

- [java/jimmer-sql](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer/tree/main/example/java/jimmer-sql) and
  [kotlin/jimmer-sql-kt](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer/tree/main/example/kotlin/jimmer-sql-kt)
  
- [java/jimmer-sql-graphql](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer/tree/main/example/java/jimmer-sql-graphql) and
  [kotlin/jimmer-sql-graphql-kt](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer/tree/main/example/kotlin/jimmer-sql-graphql-kt)
  
By default, caching is not used, and they run on embedded in-memory databases with automatic database initialization. This ensures no external environment installation is required. Just click the run button to demonstrate.

You can also start them in cache mode by running the program with the spring-boot profile `maxwell` or `debezium`. 

These two spring profiles utilize the CDC push capabilities of [maxwell](https://maxwells-daemon.io/) or [debezium](https://debezium.io/) to achieve <ViewMore buttonText="Cache Consistency"><CacheConsistencyPanel/></ViewMore>, so external environments need to be installed.

:::tip
In fact, relying on CDC push services like [maxwell](https://maxwells-daemon.io/) or [debezium](https://debezium.io/) is not the only way to achieve <ViewMore buttonText="Cache Consistency"><CacheConsistencyPanel/></ViewMore>. Even without the help of any external technology, Jimmer can also achieve this capability.

- Jimmer's own capability to capture data changes is called `Transaction Trigger` 

- Pushing database changes to Jimmer via external CDC technology is called `BinLog Trigger`

Please refer to [Trigger Classification](../mutation/trigger#trigger-classification).

`BinLog Trigger` has better performance and universality (even if the database is changed through other means that bypass Jimmer, such as directly modifying the data using a SQL IDE, it can also be intercepted), so it is the recommended solution.

Therefore, although `Transaction Trigger` can achieve <ViewMore buttonText="Cache Consistency"><CacheConsistencyPanel/></ViewMore> without relying on any special external environment,
the official examples still use `BinLog Trigger` to synchronize the cache, as this is the more recommended approach. 

So we need to set up CDC services like maxwell or debezium to push database changes to Jimmer.
:::

Enabling cache mode requires building an external environment.

1. First, you need to install docker on your local machine.

2. Install the external environment

    The accompanying examples support two external environments. Feel free to choose either one to experience <ViewMore buttonText="Cache Consistency"><CacheConsistencyPanel/></ViewMore>
    
### Maxwell + MySQL

Although [Maxwell](https://maxwells-daemon.io/) only supports MySQL, it is the simplest of all database change push technologies. So it has demonstrational value.

Open the command line, enter the local directory corresponding to [example/env-with-cache/maxwell](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer/blob/main/example/env-with-cache/maxwell), and execute
```
bash ./install.sh 
```

After installation, docker host port usage is enabled as follows

|Container Name|Port|Description|
|-|-|-|
|maxwell-demo-zookeeper|4000|Support Kafka, users do not use directly|
|maxwell-demo-kafka|4100|The exposed address is localhost, that is, assuming the docker host is your local machine. If you want to use a remote server as the docker host, you need to modify the kafka installation command in install.sh and modify the spring-boot configuration file in the examples|
|maxwell-demo-kafdrop|4101|A Kafka GUI tool, visit http://localhost:4101 with a browser| 
|maxwell-demo-mysql|4200|Database service in this mode|
|maxwell-demo-maxwell|NA|Background service that pushes MySQL changes to Kafka|
|maxwell-demo-redis|4400|Caching service in this mode|

### Debezium + Postgres

[Debezium](https://debezium.io/) supports many databases and has good versatility. The example uses it to support change propagation for Postgres. 

:::info
Postgres is a great open source database. If your project is brand new without any historical baggage, consider trying Postgres. This is why Jimmer's examples use Debezium to support Postgres.
:::

Open the command line, enter the local directory corresponding to [example/env-with-cache/debezium](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer/blob/main/example/env-with-cache/debezium), and execute
```
bash ./install.sh
```

After installation, docker host port usage is enabled as follows

|Container Name|Port|Description| 
|-|-|-|
|debezium-demo-zookeeper|5000|Support Kafka, users do not use directly|
|debezium-demo-kafka|5100|The exposed address is localhost, that is, assuming the docker host is your local machine. If you want to use a remote server as the docker host, you need to modify the kafka installation command in install.sh and modify the spring-boot configuration file in the examples|
|debezium-demo-kafdrop|5101|A Kafka GUI tool, visit http://localhost:5101 with a browser|
|debezium-demo-postgres|5200|Database service in this mode|
|debezium-demo-connect|5300|Responsible for pushing Postgres changes to Kafka using kafka-connector. You can verify whether the pg-connector named `debezium-connector` is successfully installed by visiting http://localhost:5300/connectors|
|debezium-demo-redis|5400|Caching service in this mode|
    
## Notes
:::caution
If both the `Maxwell + MySQL` and `Debezium + Postgres` external environments are installed, some containers may fail to start due to insufficient memory.

For example, on my Mac, the default memory allocated to docker is 2GB. Installing and starting all of the above containers, plus a few other unrelated containers, led to insufficient memory. The problem was resolved after setting to 3GB.
