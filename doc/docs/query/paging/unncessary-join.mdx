title: Table Join Optimization
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

In the previous article, we mentioned that Jimmer can not only auto-generate `count-query` from `data-query`, but also auto-optimize the `count-query`.

Since `count-query` only cares about total row count regardless of order and format, some table joins in the original `data-query` may not need to be copied over to `count-query`.  

Jimmer will auto-optimize `count-query` to copy over as few table joins as possible from the original data-query.

## Optimization Rules

1.  Table joins used by the where clause cannot be optimized.

    That is, **only** table joins used solely by the `select` or `order by` clause of the top-level query can be optimized.
   
2.  Table joins based on collection associations (one-to-many, many-to-many) cannot be optimized.

    Collection associations lead to duplicate data, thus affecting row count. So these table joins must be copied to `count-query` and cannot be optimized.
   
3.  Table joins based on reference associations (one-to-one, many-to-one) may be optimized, if any of the following conditions is met:

    - Join type is left outer join
    
    - Although join type is inner join, the association is based on non-null real foreign key.
    
        So-called real foreign key means there is a foreign key constraint in the database. See [Real vs Fake Foreign Keys](../../mapping/base/foreignkey).
     
In summary, to determine whether a table join in the original data-query can be automatically removed in the count-query, use the following optimization rules: 

<table>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="4">
            AND
        </td>
        <td colspan="2">
            Is based on reference association, i.e. many-to-one or one-to-one
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2">
            Is used <b>solely</b> by select or orderBy clause of top-level query
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="2">
            OR
        </td>
        <td>
            Is left outer join
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Association is non-null and foreign key constraint exists in database 
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Non-Optimizable Scenario

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java"> 

```java
BookTable book = BookTable.$;
AuthorTableEx author = AuthorTableEx.$;

ConfigurableRootQuery<BookTable, Book> query = sqlClient
    .createQuery(book)
    .where(
        book.price().between(
            new BigDecimal(20), 
            new BigDecimal(30)
        )
    )
    // highlight-next-line
    .orderBy(book.store().name())  
    .orderBy(book.name())
    .select(book);

int rowCount = query.count(); 
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val query = sqlClient.createQuery(Book::class) {
    where(
        table.price.between(
            BigDecimal(20),
            BigDecimal(30)  
        )
    )
    // highlight-next-line 
    orderBy(table.store.name) // α
    orderBy(table.name)
    select(table)
}  

val rowCount = query.count()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note α:

Although `table.store()` is only used by `orderBy` clause without being used by where clause,
-   `table.store()` is inner join
-   `Book.store` association is nullable

So the optimization rules do not apply. The count-query still needs to retain `table.store()` and ultimately generates JOIN clause in SQL:

```sql 
select
    count(tb_1_.ID)
from BOOK as tb_1_
/* highlight-start */  
inner join BOOK_STORE as tb_2_
    on tb_1_.STORE_ID = tb_2_.ID 
/* highlight-end */
where tb_1_.PRICE between ? and ?
```

## Optimizable Scenario  

For the unoptimizable case discussed above, any of the following modifications will enable optimization:

1.  Change `Book.store` association to non-null
2.  Use left outer join

Here we choose the second approach, left outer join:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
BookTable book = BookTable.$;
AuthorTableEx author = AuthorTableEx.$;

ConfigurableRootQuery<BookTable, Book> query = sqlClient
    .createQuery(book)
    .where(
        book.price().between(
            new BigDecimal(20),
            new BigDecimal(30)
        )
    )
    // highlight-next-line
    .orderBy(book.store(JoinType.LEFT).name())
    .orderBy(book.name()) 
    .select(book);

int rowCount = query.count();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">  

```kotlin 
val query = sqlClient.createQuery(Book::class) {
    where(
        table.price.between(
            BigDecimal(20),
            BigDecimal(30)
        )
    )
    // highlight-next-line
    orderBy(table.`store?`.name) // α  
    orderBy(table.name)
    select(table)
}

val rowCount = query.count() 
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now optimization can take effect. The final count-query generates SQL:

```sql
select
    count(tb_1_.ID)  
from BOOK as tb_1_
where tb_1_.PRICE between ? and ?
```
