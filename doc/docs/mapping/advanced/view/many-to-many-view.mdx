## Limitations of classic ORM associations  

In [Basic Mapping/Associative Mapping](../../base/association), we learned about the classic associative mappings in ORM, including one-to-one, many-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many.

However, there is one scenario that makes the choice of mapping mode very tangled. To show this scenario, let's start with a familiar scenario.

### Undisputed many-to-many association

Let's look at a piece of DDL

```sql
create table book(
    ...omit...
)engine=innodb;;

create table author(
    ...omit...  
) engine=innodb;

/* highlight-next-line */
create table book_author_mapping(
    book_id bigint unsigned not null,
    author_id bigint unsigned not null
) engine=innodb;
alter table book_author_mapping
    add constraint pk_book_author_mapping
        primary key(book_id, author_id)
;
alter table book_author_mapping
    add constraint fk_book_author_mapping__book
        foreign key(book_id)
            references book(id)
                on delete cascade
;
alter table book_author_mapping
    add constraint fk_book_author_mapping__author
        foreign key(author_id)
            references author(id)
                on delete cascade
;
```

In this piece of DDL, `book_author_mapping` table is very special, it only has two foreign keys, one pointing to `book` table, and one pointing to `author` table. This kind of subtable with only two foreign keys is used to express the many-to-many association between two parent tables. 

ORM's many-to-many mapping will hide the intermediate table, that is, the intermediate table does not correspond to a Java/Kotlin entity type. Therefore, the intermediate table does not need an independent primary key, but directly uses the two foreign keys as a combined primary key.

:::info
In addition to the two associative foreign keys, the intermediate table must not have any other fields, which is a limitation of many-to-many associations in ORM.
:::

The corresponding many-to-many association in ORM is as follows:

-   Owning side: `Book.authors`

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java title="Book.java" 
    @Entity
    public interface Book {

        @ManyToMany
        List<Author> authors();

        ...other code omitted...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin title="Book.kt"
    @Entity
    interface Book {

        @ManyToMany
        val authors: List<Author>

        ...other code omitted...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

-   Inverse side *(optional)*: `Author.books`

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java title="Author.java"
    @Entity
    public interface Author {

        @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "authors")
        List<Book> books();

        ...other code omitted...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin title="Author.kt"
    @Entity
    interface Author {

        @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "authors")
        val books: List<Book>

        ...other code omitted...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

### Undisputed double many-to-one association

Let's look at the second scenario, first, look at a piece of DDL

```sql
create table order_(
    ...omit...
) engine=innodb;

create table product(
    ...omit...
) engine=innodb;

/* highlight-next-line */
create table order_item(
    id bigint unsigned not null auto_increment primary key, 
    order_id bigint unsigned not null,
    product_id bigint unsigned not null,
    /* highlight-next-line */
    quantity int not null,
    /* highlight-next-line */  
    unit_price numeric(10, 2) not null
) engine=innodb;
alter table order_item
    add constraint business_key_order_item
        unique(order_id, product_id)
;
alter table order_item
    add constraint fk_order_item__order
        foreign key(order_id)
            references order_(id)
;
alter table order_item
    add constraint fk_order_item__product
        foreign key(product_id)
            references product(id)
;
```

This is a classic `order - order item - product` association.

Among them, `order-item` looks a bit like the intermediate table of many-to-many, because it has two foreign keys: `order_id` pointing to the `order_` table and `product_id` pointing to the `product` table.

However, `order-item` is not an intermediate table, because it has other business fields, `quantity` representing quantity of goods, and `unit_price` representing a snapshot of the price of goods at the time of order.

Fortunately, for the classic `order - order item - product` association, it is more intuitive to think of `order_item` as an independent entity, with two many-to-one associations pointing to `order_` and `product` respectively;
Rather than viewing `order-item` as a join table and thinking there is a many-to-many relationship between `order_` and `product`.

It is precisely because `order_item` is regarded as an independent entity that `order_item` uses an independent primary key.

We can map these three tables in ORM using two many-to-one associations

-   `OrderItem.order` and `OrderItem.product`

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java title="OrderItem.java"
    @Entity
    public interface OrderItem {

        @ManyToOne
        // highlight-next-line
        Order order();

        @ManyToOne
        // highlight-next-line
        Product product();

        int quantity();

        BigDecimal unitPrice();

        ...other code omitted...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin title="OrderItem.kt"
    @Entity
    interface OrderItem {

        @ManyToOne
        // highlight-next-line
        val order: Order

        @ManyToOne
        // highlight-next-line
        val product: Product

        val quantity: Int

        val unitPrice: BigDecimal

        ...other code omitted...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

-   `Order.items`

    In such systems, it is often necessary to get the detail list according to the order, so we define a one-to-many property `Order.items` as a mirror of `OrderItem.order`.

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

    ```java title="Order.java"
    @Entity
    @Table(name = "ORDER_")
    public interface Order {

        @OneToMany(mappedBy = "order")
        List<OrderItem> items();

        ...other code omitted...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

    ```kotlin title="Order.kt"
    @Entity
    @Table(name = "ORDER_")
    interface Order {

        @OneToMany(mappedBy = "order")
        val items: List<OrderItem>

        ...other code omitted...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

-   Do not provide `Product.items`

    In such systems, it is rarely necessary to get the detail list based on the product *(if starting the analysis from the product side, it is usually a complex query rather than a simple association)*, so a one-way `OrderItem.product` association is sufficient.

    So there is no need to show the code for the `Product` entity.

### The controversial, tangled scenario

In the previous text, we showed two business scenarios

-   Scenario 1: The intermediate table `book_author_mapping` is very clean, with only two foreign key fields, and is naturally mapped to a many-to-many association

-   Scenario 2: `order_item` looks like an intermediate table but is not an intermediate table, because in addition to the two foreign keys it also needs to have other business fields.
    Fortunately, people will choose to treat OrderItem as an independent entity and use two many-to-one associations to string the three entity types together.

Next, let's look at scenario 3, first look at the DDL:

```sql
create table student(
    ...omit...
)engine=innodb;;

create table course(
    ...omit...
) engine=innodb;

/* highlight-next-line */
create table learning_link (
    id bigint unsigned not null auto_increment primary key,
    student_id bigint unsigned not null,
    course_id bigint unsigned not null,
    /* highlight-next-line */
    score int
) engine=innodb;
alter table learning_link
    add constraint pk_student_course_mapping
        primary key(student_id, course_id)
;
alter table learning_link
    add constraint fk_student_course_mapping__student
        foreign key(student_id)
            references student(id)
                on delete cascade
;
alter table learning_link
    add constraint fk_student_course_mapping__course
        foreign key(course_id)
            references course(id)
                on delete cascade
;
```

This piece of DDL represents the elective course system in schools. There is a many-to-many relationship between students and elective courses.

-   For students, it is of course very important to know which courses they have chosen

-   For schools, it is also very important to know which students have chosen each course, because teacher resources and teaching venues need to be arranged based on this information

That is, for the student entity and the course entity, associating with each other and querying each other is an important and high frequency operation. Therefore, abstracting bidirectional many-to-many associations between `student` and `course` is a very good choice.

Unfortunately, the elective relationship table `learning_link` has a `score` field that can be null, null indicating that the exam has not yet taken place, non-null indicating the score after the exam. 

-   Because of the existence of this field, the intermediate table is no longer clean, and cannot be simply mapped to the classic ORM many-to-many association. That is, this is not a simple scenario 1.

-   Of course, we can handle this problem using the method of scenario 2, treating `learning_link` as an independent entity, and using two many-to-one associations to string the three entity types together.

    However, for a large part of the upper layer business, what they really care about is only the mutual association between `student` and `course`, and they don't care about the `score` field of the `learning_link` table. 
    *(That is, the non-foreign key business field `learning_link`.`score` of the intermediate table is far less important than the relevant fields in scenario 2)*.
    In this case, scenario 2's solution will bring a higher cognitive burden, and scenario 1's way of thinking is obviously simpler.
  
:::info  
This scenario is actually the most tangled scenario in classic ORM, which cannot be simply mapped to many-to-many associations, while hoping that some upper layer business can adopt the many-to-many mentality to simplify the problem.

`@ManyToManyView` is a powerful tool designed for such scenarios.
:::

## Getting Started with ManyToManyView

For the discussed scenario 3 above, Jimmer gave a two-step solution.

1.  Basic association mapping:

    First, treat `learning_link` as an independent entity according to scenario 2, and provide two many-to-one associations pointing to `student` and `course` respectively;
    Conversely, `student` and `course` also use one-to-many associations to reference `learning_link`. That is, use two bidirectional one-to-many associations to string the three entity types together.

2.  Use `@ManyToManyView`:

    Then, on the basis of the first step, use `@ManyToManyView` to quickly simulate the effect of scenario 1.
   
### Basic relationship mapping

    The current property `Student.courses` can be obtained in two steps:

    -   ❷ `deeperProp = "course"`

        For each `LearningLink` object obtained in the previous step, `Course` can be further obtained through the `LearningLink.course` property ②
       
        :::tip

## The essence of @ManyToManyView 

-   The property declared by `@ManyToManyView` does not maintain its own data, it is only a view of the original property, which proxies and wraps the collection returned by the original property.

    Take the Java example in this article `Student` side as an example (the `Course` side is the same).

    -   Original association property: List&lt;LearningLink&gt; learningLinks();

    -   View association property: List&lt;Course&gt; courses();

    You can understand the ManyToManyView view property with this pseudocode:

    ```java
    @Override  
    public List<Course> courses() {
        return new ListProxy<>(
            this.learningLinks(),  
            LearningLink::course
        );
    }
    ```

    The view association property returns a proxy collection that wraps the collection of the original property and transforms the elements of the original collection.

    It is obvious that the two are essentially the same and share the same data.

-   When constructing entity objects, only the original property can be set, not the view property.

    This is different from [@IdView](./id-view). For [@IdView](./id-view), both the original property and the view property can be set.

-   Whether it is the original property or the view property, the preprocessor will generate code to match them, so both can be used in [object fetchers](../../../query/object-fetcher) and strongly typed SQL DSL.
