## Concepts

In the [Spring section](../spring), we discussed how to implement REST services with Jimmer and automatically generate client code like TypeScript. 

In addition, Jimmer also supports another development mode to build [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) services, which is what this article series will discuss.

:::caution
So far, the GraphQL protocol does not support recursive queries for self-associated properties.

Therefore, it is not possible to expose functionality like [recursive queries in object fetchers](../query/object-fetcher/recursive) through GraphQL. This is a functionality sacrifice that must currently be accepted when using GraphQL.
:::

Jimmer's support for GraphQL is based on [Spring GraphQL](https://spring.io/projects/spring-graphql).
So the project needs to import both the Jimmer and Spring GraphQL Spring Boot starters, for example:

<Tabs groupId="buildTool">
<TabItem value="maven" label="Maven">

```xml title="pom.xml"  
...other code omitted...

<build>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.babyfish.jimmer</groupId>
      <artifactId>jimmer-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
      <version>${jimmer.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-graphql</artifactId>
      <version>${spring.boot.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    ...other dependencies omitted...
  </dependencies>
</build>

...other code omitted...
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

```groovy title="build.gradle"
dependencies {
  implementation "org.babyfish.jimmer:jimmer-spring-boot-starter:${jimmerVersion}"
  implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-graphql'

  ...other dependencies omitted...  
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
If the Jimmer entity types are also defined in the GraphQL project rather than in a separate project, the preprocessor (Annotation Processor for Java, KSP for Kotlin) should also be configured in the build script.

This has already been discussed in detail in the [Generate Code](../overview/get-started/generate-code) article and will not be repeated here.
:::

[Spring GraphQL](https://spring.io/projects/spring-graphql) is a Schema-First rather than Code-First approach. 
Therefore, developers need to create the file `src/main/resources/graphql/schema.graphqls` in the project and define the GraphQL schema in it.

This file is a requirement of [Spring GraphQL](https://spring.io/projects/spring-graphql). The GraphQL schema content is a standard language that is unrelated to Jimmer, so this article will not explain it. Please refer to the [GraphQL Schema in the example](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/jimmer/blob/main/example/java/jimmer-sql-graphql/src/main/resources/graphql/schema.graphqls). 

## Notes

:::caution
In the current version, there is a limitation that when providing GraphQL services, [simple calculated properties based on SQL](../mapping/advanced/calculated/formula#sql-based-calculation) should NOT be used.
